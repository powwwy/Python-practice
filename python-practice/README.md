Task 1. Sum all elements in a list

use user input to add a fresh twist to the code. 
First allowing the user to set the number of items they want.
Then allowing the user to add the numbers to the list.
Then summing the items.

Task 2. Check if a number is even or odd

Allowed users to enter their numbers
used a simple if statement to check and output the results
works as exoected.

Task 3. Calculate factorial using a loop

User input
Set 0 to have the factorial of 1
Create a loop to reduce the user input 
calculate the result and print

Task 4. Reverse a string without using in built functions

User inputs their word
Decdied to use recursion because im limited to that or a loop
The function takes the last index and returns the string in the reverse

Task 5. Factorial using recursive functions

Create a function that lops itself until the base case has been met
allow the user to enter the value they want
output the results and test for accuracy

Task 6. Sum of digits 

Multiple ways to do this.
I decided to use a list and the pop function to find the sum of a digit
User input stored as a list 
Find and display sum
